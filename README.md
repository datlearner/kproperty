KProperty Website 🏡
KProperty is a real estate website built with React and Tailwind CSS. The project showcases various properties, but its main purpose is to test and improve my skills in:

✅ Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
✅ React components and state management
✅ Structuring a scalable React project

This project is based on a Figma design I created and serves as a practical test of my frontend development skills. 🚀
